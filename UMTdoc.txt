Since there must be 2 subsets with the same avg we can write the following relation: sum(A)/nA = sum(B)/nB, where nA
and nB are the number of elements in each subse. The right side of the relation can be rewritten as 
(sum-sum(A))/(n-nA), where sum is the sum of all elements in the initial set and n is total number of elements.
From this we can deduce that sum(A) = nA*sum/n. We can verify the possibility of obtaining such subsets by verifying for
each number of elements smaller than n, if (i*sum)%n == 0. If it is true, then we can proceed, otherwise, it is 
impossible to have 2 subsets with the same average.
First we compute the sum of all elements and the average of the initial set, which will have to also be the average of 
our two sets.
Then, we create a structure in which we correlate the sum of elements with the number of elements that make up that sum.
We initialize the sum 0 with 0 number of elements.
Then, for each number in the initial array, the sum will be the respective number, and number of elements 1, 
then for each sum of every pair of 2 numbers and so on.
We look through the structure for a number of elements that is smaller than the length of the initial array, and check 
if the average for that for that number is equal to the one that we are looking for. If it is than we return true.
